# Ballistic Spreading Check
# Author: Edmund Dable-Heath
"""
    The original lattice planar graph CTQW paper was only interested in 2 dimensional analysis. Whilst not explicitly
    stated the key reason this appeared to be the case was for computational ease as simulating the quantum walk for
    much higher dimensions becomes infeasible. Their work implies that a CTQW on a square PLG in 2 dimensions, Z^2,
    exhibits ballistic spreading, i.e. var(Jt) >= (Jt)^2. This feels like it should extend to higher dimension, but
    does it?

    An analytic proof of this would be good as well, but some numerical simulations would be rather easy to achieve so
    those can be run first.

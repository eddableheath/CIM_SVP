# Continuous Time Quantum Walk Simulation
# Author: Edmund Dable-Heath
# This is going to be a very rudimentary simulation of a continuous time quantum walk for an arbitrary graph. The idea
# to have as inputs an adjacency matrix, a permeation time and a hopping amplitude. This should fully describe the
# entire simulation. It won't be efficient, I'll work on that afterward.
